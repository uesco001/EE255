We fairly spend equivalent and enough time on the homework projects, including this proj#4. We meet up together, program together and discuss the incoming issues at the meantime. For the first two questions we were coding individually and have worked out two versions of codes. Both of our codes work properly. For part 3 and 4 we worked together on organizing the coding algorithm. Uriel as an excellent teammate, has always been very helpful and helped me/Jinwei fixed many programming errors.
